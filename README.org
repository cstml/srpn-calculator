* SPRN Calculator

A reverse engineered toy language that is meant to emulate [[https://replit.com/@bathuniversity/sprn-to-emulate][this]] black box
calculator (some previous coursework from Uni. of Bath). Done for fun, the toy
language uses a _recursive descent parser_ written from scratch.

* What does it do

- numbers get pushed to the stack;
- operations pops 2 numbers and push the result;
- ~r~ gives you a pseudo-random number;
- ~d~ prints the stack;
- ~=~ prints the top of the stack;

* How to run it?

You can either pipe into the binary or use it as a repl.

** Via NIX
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # for repl
  nix run github:cstml/srpn-calculator
  # for pipe
  echo " 1 2 + = " |  nix run github:cstml/srpn-calculator
#+END_SRC

** Building it and running it locally
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
  # to run
  make run
  # to build
  make
#+END_SRC
